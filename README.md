# Mi Card

Mi Card is a personal business card, integrated into an app. I learned how to code this app from Module 6 of the free Flutter development course at https://www.appbrewery.co/courses/intro-to-flutter.

## Things learned from this module

* How to create Stateless Widgets
* What is the difference between hot reload and hot refresh and running an app from cold
* How to use Containers to lay out your UI
* How to use Columns and Rows to position your UI elements
* How to add custom fonts
* How to add Material icons
* How to style Text widgets
* How to read and use Flutter Documentation
